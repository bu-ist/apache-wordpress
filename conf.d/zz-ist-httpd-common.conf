# /etc/httpd/conf.d/zz-ist-httpd-common.conf
#
# This Apache supplementary configuration file is for placement in /etc/httpd/conf.d/
# to flexibly define ingredients desired in the BU IS&T Web servers environment.
# Provided herein are definitions which provide functionality for:
#  - Process status info from the server
#  - Apache configuration info
#  - Proxy balancer info
#  - Perl status
#  - Access control for all of the above.
#
# PACKAGING:  RPM ist-httpd-common
#
# NOTES:  - This file originally installed via name ist-httpd-common.conf.  However,
#	    with that name its perl-status would not work, which was found caused by
#	    mod_perl being LoadModule'd by perl.conf - which per collating sequence
#	    in the directory instates after an 'i' name.  The reasonable solution was
#	    to use name zz-ist-httpd-common.conf, which assures that all modules have
#	    been loaded.  Also, as a site configuration addition, it is appropriate
#	    for it to be after system configuration entries.
#
# HISTORY:  2010/??/?? Engineered by David King.
#	    2015/07/20 Internal doc augmentation.  Package as an RPM, for pure Apache,
#		       as we move away from BU Apache conventions.  Richard Sims
#	    2016/06/16 Apache is now enforcing rule that comments may not appear on
#		       the same lines as directives.  RBS
#	    2016/11/22 Allow 10.254.17 for F5 healthcheck monitoring.  RBS
#           2017/03/22 Alias /server to a file (doesn't need to exist) to prevent
#                      subsequent rewrite rules from triggering.  Nik
#           2017/03/24 Allow any IP to use the healthcheck URL and remove F5 IPs from /server location.  David King
#           2017/03/31 Allow server status/info access from VPN, as requested by Inder
#		       and approved by Nik.  RBS
#           2017/05/05 Allow server status/info access from Relay7, for checking.  rbs
#           2018/05/22 Add AD-ADMIN ranges, recommended by David King.  rbs
#           2019/06/25 Remove software33 (decommissioned).  Add Zenoss subnet per INC12121338.  rbs
#           2021/04/30 Versioned for Apache 2.2 versus 2.4.  hl-c, rbs
#           2021/08/16 Allow 128.197.197 for 2021 UISCGI httpd status queries. rbs
